## Authentication Activity
```shell
curl -XPOST https://collection.inspcdn.net/auth \
    -d '{
        "account_id": "232550",
        "action":     "login_failure"
    }'
```

Account login/logout behavior is highly correlated with fraudulent activity. You can send information about successful or failed login attempts for an account (as well as logouts) via the `/auth` endpoint, which supports `POST` requests only.

The following fields are required:

Argument    | Type   | Description
--------    | ----   | -----------
account_id  | String | The account ID that was (or was attempted to be) logged into\
action      | String | What type of authentication activity occurred. Accepted values are limited to `'login_failure'`, `'login_success'`, and `'logout'` (case-insensitive).
