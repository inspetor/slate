### Event Datetimes 
```sh
    {
        "id":           "201",
        "datetime": 1594315000
    }
```
Our data model operates with the assumption that a single event listing could have multiple sessions (for example Lollapalooza may have multiple sessions, but all be considered the same event.) We refer to those sessions as "event datetimes." Whenever you're creating an event, or even when you're selling tickets to an event, you should indicate which event datetime or datetimes should be correlated with that action. 

An event datetime requires the following information: 

Property     | Type    | Description
--------     | ----    | -----------
id           | String  | The identifier for this event datetime in your platform. Event datetime IDs must be unique per-event (but event datetime ids can be the same if they are sessions of different events)
datetime     | Integer | The Unix-timestamp corresponding to the date and time of the event datetime
