## Event Activity

You can send event-related information to Inspetor via the REST API. The `/events` endpoint supports `POST` (create), `PUT` (update), and `DELETE` (delete) operations with the following arguments:

Property            | When is it required?   | Type    | Description
--------            | ---------------------  | ----    | -----------
id                  | `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`| String  | The unique identifier of this event listing in your platform
name                | `POST`                 | String  | The name of the event
is_physical         | `POST`                 | Bool    | It determines if it is a physical or digital event. *The default value is `true`.*
dates               | `POST`                 | Array of Inspetor [event datetimes](#event-datetimes) | All available dates and times that the event occurs (if it has more than one) and a unique id for each date/time.
creator_id          | `POST`                 | String  | The id of the user who created the event
admin_ids           | `POST`                 | Array   | An array containing the ids of all users who can make changes to the event
address             |                        | [Address](#addresses) | The address where the event is happening. *This field is only required if the type of the event is set to physical.*
status              |                        | String  | The status of the event. *Inspetor provides some pre-built statuses (`draft`, `private` and `published`) but you can provide a custom status if it does not fit with our status model.* 
description         |                        | String  | A description of the event
slug                |                        | String  | The slug of the event
