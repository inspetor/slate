## Account Activity

The following functions will be used to relay actions associated with an account:

- <a href="#account-creation">trackAccountCreation</a>
- <a href="#account-updates">trackAccountUpdate</a>
- <a href="#account-deletion">trackAccountDeletion</a>

Identical functionality is also available via the REST API. The `/accounts` endpoint supports POST, UPDATE, and DELETE operations with the following required arguments:

If you are using the Python or PHP SDKs, the functions for tracking account-related actions require an [InspetorAccount](#inspetoraccount) object as an argument and return `true` upon successful execution. Otherwise, one of the following exceptions will be thrown:

Exception | Description
--------- | -----------
**[AccountException](#inspetoraccountexception)**   | The Account object provided is not a valid Inspetor Account
**[AddressException](#inspetoraddressexception)**   | The Address object provided as a property of the Account object invalid
**[generalException](#inspetorgeneralexception)**   | The timestamps passed as Account object properties are invalid
**[TrackerException](#trackerexception)**   | An internal error occurred (*This should never happen*)
