### Transfer Updates
```shell
curl -X PUT https://collection-prod.inspcdn.net/transfer \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "id":     "43262",
        "status": "accepted"
    }'      

```


This function is used to send information to Inspetor every time an item (*e.g. ticket*) transfer's status is updated.
