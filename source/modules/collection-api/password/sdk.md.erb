The following functions notify Inspetor of password changes initiated by  users within your platform, independent of whether the user is logged in or not:

- <a href="#password-reset">trackPasswordReset</a>
- <a href="#password-recovery">trackPasswordRecovery</a>

All functions for tracking authentication events require an [InspetorPassRecovery](#inspetorpassrecovery) object as an argument and return `true` upon successful execution. Otherwise, one of the following exceptions will be thrown:

Exception | Description
--------- | -----------
**[PassRecoveryException](#inspetorpassrecoveryexception)** | The PassRecovery object provided is invalid
**[generalException](#inspetorgeneralexception)**         | The timestamps passed as PassRecovery object properties are invalid
**[TrackerException](#trackerexception)**           | An internal error occurred (*This should never happen*)
