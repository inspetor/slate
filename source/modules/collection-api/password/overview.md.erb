## Password Activity
```shell
curl -XPOST https://collection-prod.inspcdn.net/forgot-password \
    -d '{
        "recovery_email": "badguy@yahoo.com",
        "action":         "reset"
    }'
```

Unsurprisingly, there is a correlation between fraudulent activity on an account and password resets or password recovery. As such, Inspetor provides an endpoint where you should notify us of _any_ behavior that involves a user resetting their password or initiating password recovery. You should send information to this endpoint when a user who is not logged in either resets or recovers their password.

<aside class="notice">
This is different than when a logged-in user changes their password. You can notify Inspetor of such changes via the accounts endpoint.

The `/forgot-password` endpoint accepts `POST` requests only and requires the following arguments

Property           | Type    | Description
--------           | ----    | -----------
recovery_email     | String  | The email used to recover or reset the password
action             | String  | The type of user action that was taken. Accepted values are `'recovery'` and `'reset'` (case-insensitive)
