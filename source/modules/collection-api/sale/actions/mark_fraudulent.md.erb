### Mark Sale Fraudulent
```shell
curl -X POST https://collection-prod.inspcdn.net/sale/mark_fraudulent \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "id":                "12345",
        "fraud_signal_type": "chargeback"
    }'
```
Additionally, there is a `/sales/mark_fraudulent` endpoint that you should use to update Inspetor when a sale has been rejected or refunded due to suspicion of fraud, or if a sale has resuled in a chargeback.

If a sale is deemed fraudulent (either via your existing antifraud solution, manual analysis, acquirer rejection, or even if you receive a chargeback), it is extremely important that you relay this information to Inspetor. This is perhaps _the most valuable piece of information_ you can send to us; all of our fraud prediction models are trained on this label. 

The `/sale/mark_fraudulent` endpoint supports the `POST` operation and requires the following arguments:

Property              | When is it required? | Type   | Description
--------              | ---------            | ----   | -----------
sale_id               | `POST`               | String | The unique identifier for the sale within your platform
fraud_signal_type     | `POST`               | String | The mechanism by which you identified the sale as fraudulent. Current accepted values are 'acquirer', other antifraud services such as **'horus'**, **'fraudnet'**, and **'sift'**, your company name (**'ingresse'**), or simply **'chargeback'**.

Note: it is expected that when marking a sale fraudulent, one would also make a corresponding call to the `/sales` endpoint to update a sale with a `rejected` status (unless the sale was marked fraudulent only after a chargeback was received).
