### Sale Items

```shell
{
    "item_id":           "101",
    "value":             25.00,
    "event_id":          23553,
    "event_session_ids": ["101", "102"]
}
```

Our current collection API is built with certain assumptions about the ticketing industry. In particular, we assume that a sale will have one or more items (in the case of the ticketing industry, tickets) associated with it. We require some information about these items in order to reason about the sale:

Property        | When is it required?  | Type | Description
--------        | --------------------- | ---- | -----------
**id**          | `POST`, `UPDATE`      | String  | A unique identifier for this item (*e.g. ticket*) within your platform
**event_id**    | `POST`                | String  | The unique identifier of the [event](#event-activity) that the item is tied too
**session_ids** | `POST`                | Array   | The array of [event session IDs](#event-sessions) that the ticket is tied to
**price**       | `POST`                | Double  | The price of the item. *It should only contain numbers, dots, or commas*
**quantity**    | `POST`                | Integer | The number of item of this type being bought.
